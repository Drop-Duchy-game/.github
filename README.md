This game is more than just running and fighting. Every step you take matters. If you stop, the danger catches you. As you move through the city, you’ll meet new characters. Some may help you. Others may not. Your decisions shape the story and affect who survives.

Your team needs food, rest, and safety. You’ll search buildings for supplies, defend yourself with weapons, and make tough calls. Should you save someone or move on? Should you take the risk or stay hidden? It’s all part of the journey.
